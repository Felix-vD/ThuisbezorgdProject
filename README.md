   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

Log in to your Expo account in DevTools (or expo login in CLI).

Install Expo Go on your iOS/Android device.

In DevTools or CLI, select “Run on Android device/emulator” or “Run on iOS simulator”, or scan the QR code with Expo Go.

The app will load your local bundle.

To test deep links or email redirects, make sure your device is on the same network (or use the “Tunnel” connection).
